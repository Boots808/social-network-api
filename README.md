## Description

The purpose of this application is social network application

## Installation

you will need to download all files, use NPM install for dependencies. Using Insomnia.

## Learnings and Future Developments

I learned that it is the most difficult to get MongoDB up and running and to have all connections working smoothly through Insomnia. I still need to work on this in the future to allow for put/get/post requests since i was unable to get that piece workng when initially setting this up. I had multiple open tickets with askBCS and still had issues getting this solved.
